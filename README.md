# Cash Shop Mod

This mod is inspired by the Grand Fantasia Item Mall (Cash Shop):
![Grand-Fantasia-Item-Mall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20dd899-351e-4601-b96e-fec5d0488a0d)
It allows modpackers to create a cash shop using KubeJS only, without any configuration files:
(I would have liked to use the Grand Fantasia UI instead of the Minecraft one, but it’s too large :'D)

# Mod supported:
- JEI: [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) Enables the JEI UI to adapt to the shop UI size.
- FTBQuest: [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-quests-forge) Not implemented yet but planned. The goal is to add quests that reward currency upon completion!
